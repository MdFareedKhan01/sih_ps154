# SIH26154 — Frontend Guide (Person C)

Sep 25, 2026 · @Shahil Khan

You own `apps/web` — the half of the product a judge actually looks at. By Sunday 27 September, clicking any sentence in a generated artefact must light up the passage it came from.

The Final SRS is the contract; this guide is the build order. Where they disagree, the SRS wins and you tell the team.

## 1. Your job and your finish line

You build four screens and one interaction. The screens make the pipeline usable; the interaction — click a sentence, see where it came from — is what makes a judge believe the output is not invented (SRS §5.5).

  L[Login] --> I["Ingest<br/>paste or upload, classify"]

  C --> W["Workspace<br/>source pane + live cards"]
  W --> R["Review<br/>approve or reject"]
  W -->|regenerate one card| W
```

### What you own

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Every screen, component, state and style | `apps/web/src/` |
| Mock data for every card state | `apps/web/src/mocks/` |
| The provenance interaction | `apps/web/src/components/ClaimSpan.tsx`, `SourcePane.tsx` |
| The screenshots in the deck | handed to A on Sunday |
| Component and state tests | `apps/web/src/**/*.test.ts(x)` (Step 9) |

### The acceptance criteria you answer for

| AC | You prove | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-2 | Selecting a claim highlights its source passage | Sun 27 |
| AC-9 | A failed card shows Retry while the others display; the batch reads `partial` | Sun 27 |
| AC-11 | A card whose config was overridden shows a badge | Sat 26 |
| AC-13 | With B: the socket drops and reconnects, and no card is stranded | Sun 27 |
| AC-16 | With D: the card shows `1 fix` and exactly what was repaired | Sun 27 |
| AC-18 | A claim from a PDF shows its page number | Sun 27 if time, else Phase 2 |
| AC-6 | The review screens | Phase 2 |

### Hand-offs

| Direction | What | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From D | One real result JSON per format, for mocks | Fri 25, evening |
| From B | Login, ingest, batch and stream endpoints running | Sat 26, evening |
| To A | Six screenshots, listed in Step 8 | Sun 27, evening |

### The team and the repository

| | Role | Name | GitHub |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Deck & narrative | Rehan Fazal | [@Rehan9599](https://github.com/Rehan9599) |
| B | Backend | Farhan Quamar | [@quamarfarhan007](https://github.com/quamarfarhan007) |
| C | Frontend | Faizan Ahmad Ansari | [@Faizan0916](https://github.com/Faizan0916) |
| D | AI systems, repository owner | Md Fareed Khan | [@MdFareedKhan01](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01) |

The code lives at [github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154): [pull requests](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154/pulls) · [CI runs](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154/actions). The repository is **public**: never commit `.env`, a key or real data. Reviews are requested automatically from each folder's owner (`.github/CODEOWNERS`).

## 2. Your four days

Each day ends at a gate. If a gate slips, cut polish from the next day, never the gate.

| Day | Build | Done means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fri 25** | Setup (Step 0). Hour zero with the team (Step 1). Wireframes agreed (Step 2). Login and routing (Step 3) | A `/gallery` page renders every card state from mock data, and login works against B's API |
| **Sat 26** | Ingest, confirm and configure (Step 4). Workspace state and socket (Step 5), against B's stub engine | Pasting the demo source produces cards that move through their states live |
| **Sun 27** | Cards (Step 6). The provenance split view (Step 7). Polish and screenshots (Step 8) | AC-2, AC-9, AC-13 and AC-16 pass; six screenshots sent to A |
| **Mon 28** | Freeze. Projector check. Help A record the video | The demo runs three times in a row without anyone touching code |

- [ ] Friday gate
- [ ] Saturday gate
- [ ] Sunday gate
- [ ] Monday gate

**A gate counts only once it is on `main`.** Work on a branch, test it (Step 9) and merge it through a pull request (Step 10). One screen or component per PR keeps reviews to minutes.

**Build against mocks, always.** The `/gallery` page renders every card in every state from files in `mocks/`. You never wait for B or D, and A can screenshot states that are hard to trigger on demand, such as an error card or a flagged one.

## Step 0 — Setup

The app is already scaffolded in `apps/web`, inside the monorepo, so there is nothing to create. Get the repo running on your machine — the same commands the whole team runs at hour zero (Guide B, Step 1):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154.git && cd sih_ps154
npm install                    # every workspace, one lockfile
cp .env.example .env           # PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run dev:web                # http://localhost:5173 shows a placeholder page
npm run test -w @ps154/web     # one placeholder test passes
```

You need Docker only to run B's API on your own laptop, from Saturday. Until then you build against mocks.

**What the scaffold already contains.**

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web/package.json` | `@ps154/web`: React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript 6, `react-router`, Tailwind 4 and `@ps154/shared`; Vitest, Testing Library and jsdom for tests. Scripts: `dev`, `build`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:watch`, `lint` |
| `vite.config.ts` | Below |
| `src/index.css` | `@import "tailwindcss";` and nothing else |
| `src/test/setup.ts` | Loads the Testing Library matchers, clears the DOM after each test, and stubs `scrollIntoView`, which jsdom lacks and `SourcePane` calls |
| `tsconfig.app.json` | Vite's strict defaults, plus `resolveJsonModule` for the mock imports. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is removed, because `ApiError` in Step 3 uses constructor parameter properties |
| `src/main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `App.test.tsx` | A placeholder page and its test. Step 3 replaces `main.tsx`; delete the other two then |

**`apps/web/vite.config.ts`** — the proxy sends REST calls and the WebSocket to B's API, so the browser never meets CORS and no host names are hard-coded. The `test` block runs component tests in jsdom, a simulated browser.

```ts
/// <reference types="vitest/config" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  server: {
    // REST calls and the WebSocket go to B's API, so the browser never meets CORS.
    proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8080', ws: true } },
  },
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
  },
});
```

**Adding a package.** From the repo root: `npm i <package> -w @ps154/web`. Never run a bare `npm i` inside `apps/web`; it would create a second lockfile. `npm run lint -w @ps154/web` runs oxlint: treat its warnings as advice, not a gate.

**The folders you will fill.**

```text
apps/web/src/
  main.tsx          router
  api.ts            fetch wrapper, token, socket URL
  selection.tsx     which claim is selected (context)
  pages/            Login, Ingest, Confirm, Workspace, Review, Gallery
  batch/            state.ts (reducer), useBatchStream.ts
  components/       Card, CardBoundary, VerificationBadge, ClaimSpan,
                    SourcePane, FactsPanel, ConfigPanel
  renderers/        Advisory, ExecutiveSummary, LinkedInPost, Generic
  mocks/            JSON for every state
  test/setup.ts     test setup (already there)
```

Tests sit beside the file they test: `Card.tsx` and `Card.test.tsx` (Step 9).

## Step 1 — Hour zero: the types you consume

You write no schemas; you import them. D defines claims, the canonical object and the formats; B defines the API and the frames. Everything is snake\_case, exactly as it arrives over the wire.

```ts
import type {
  Claim, ClaimStatus, Span, Canonical, Config, FormatId, Verification,
  Artifact, BatchCreated, BatchSnapshot, Frame, SourceRecord,
} from '@ps154/shared';
```

**The four shapes you render.**

| Shape | What it is | You use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Claim` | `{ id, text, source_refs, status, grounded }` | Every sentence you render as clickable |
| `Artifact` | The envelope: `status`, `content`, `verification`, `meta`, `version` | One card |
| `Frame` | `task.progress`, `task.completed`, `task.failed`, `batch.completed` | Live updates |
| `SourceRecord` | `raw_content` plus `spans` with offsets and optional `page` | The source pane and the facts panel |

**`content` is `unknown` on purpose.** Each format has its own layout, but every assertion inside it is a claim node. You render content by walking it: any object with `text`, `status` and `source_refs` is a claim, and becomes a `ClaimSpan`.

**`apps/web/src/mocks/advisory.ready.json`** — hand-written for Friday. On Saturday, replace every mock with a real `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}` response from B.

```json
{
  "task_id": "t-adv", "batch_id": "b-demo", "format_id": "advisory",
  "effective_config": { "audience": "Sector CISOs", "tone": "formal", "detail": "medium", "language": "en" },
  "status": "ready", "review_state": "draft", "review_comment": null, "error_log": null, "version": 1,
  "grounding_score": 0.8,
  "verification": {
    "passed": true, "revised": true, "open_issues": [],
    "fixes": [ { "check": "identifier", "key": "identifier:42",
      "detail": "\"42 organisations were exposed\" cites span_6, which reads \"...37 organisations...\". 42 does not appear in the cited source." } ]
  },
  "meta": { "provider": "cloud", "model": "gemini-flash", "fallback_reason": null,
            "attempts": 2, "latency_ms": 8420, "perturbed": true },
  "claims": [],
  "content": {
    "title": "Credential phishing against power distribution utilities",
    "severity": "high",
    "summary": [
      { "id": "c1", "status": "inference", "grounded": true, "source_refs": ["span_6"],
        "text": "Between 14 and 17 September 2026, 37 organisations recorded indicators consistent with a possible phishing campaign." },
      { "id": "c2", "status": "fact", "grounded": true, "source_refs": ["span_8"],
        "text": "Three organisations have confirmed credential compromise." }
    ],
    "affected_systems": [
      { "id": "c3", "status": "fact", "grounded": true, "source_refs": ["span_13"],
        "text": "Edge VPN concentrators running firmware version 9.4.2." }
    ],
    "indicators": [ { "type": "domain", "value": "login-verify.example[.]com", "source_refs": ["span_17"] } ],
    "mitigations": [
      { "id": "c4", "status": "fact", "grounded": true, "source_refs": ["span_25"],
        "text": "Reset VPN credentials for all users at affected organisations." },
      { "id": "c5", "status": "inference", "grounded": false, "source_refs": [],
        "text": "Treat any unexplained VPN login since 14 September as a potential compromise." }
    ],
    "references": []
  }
}
```

The mock deliberately holds one of each claim style: a fact, an inference, and an unverified inference (`c5`). Span ids here are illustrative; the Saturday mocks carry real ones that match the real source.

**The other states are one-liners.** Copy the envelope and set `status` to `waiting`, `running`, `validating` or `revising` with `content: null`; or to `error` with `error_log: "Schema invalid after the targeted revision"`. For a flagged card, keep `ready` and move the fix into `open_issues`.

## Step 2 — The screens

Agree these four layouts with A on Friday, because the deck's screenshots come from them. Wording on screen matters: the classification text and the badges are read aloud in the demo.

**Ingest.** The classification choice states its consequence in plain words (SRS §11.5).

```

**Confirm and configure.** The facts panel is a demo beat: it proves the system understood the source before writing anything.

```

**Workspace.** The source pane on the left, one independent card per format on the right. Selecting a sentence in a card highlights its passage on the left.

```

**Review**, in Phase 2: a queue of submitted artefacts on the left, the same card and source pane on the right, and *Approve* or *Reject with a comment* underneath.

## Step 3 — API client, login and routing

Every request goes through one function that adds the token, parses errors into readable messages, and sends a signed-out user back to the login page.

**`apps/web/src/api.ts`**

```ts
const KEY = 'ps154.token';
const stored = () => { try { return localStorage.getItem(KEY); } catch { return null; } };
let token: string | null = stored();

export function setToken(t: string | null) {
  token = t;
  try { if (t) localStorage.setItem(KEY, t); else localStorage.removeItem(KEY); } catch { /* private window */ }
}
export const getToken = () => token;

/** The signed-in user, read from the token's payload. */
export function getUser(): { id: string; name: string; role: 'operator' | 'reviewer' | 'admin' } | null {
  if (!token) return null;
  try { return JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1].replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/'))); }
  catch { return null; }
}

export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(public status: number, message: string, public body?: any) { super(message); }
}

export async function api<T>(path: string, init: RequestInit = {}): Promise<T> {
  const headers = new Headers(init.headers);
  if (token) headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
  if (init.body && !(init.body instanceof FormData)) headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  const res = await fetch(`/api/v1${path}`, { ...init, headers });
  const body = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));
  if (res.status === 401 && path !== '/auth/login') { setToken(null); location.assign('/login'); }
  if (!res.ok) throw new ApiError(res.status, body.error ?? res.statusText, body);
  return body as T;
}

/** Exports return files, not JSON. */
export async function download(path: string, filename: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/v1${path}`, { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(await res.blob());
  Object.assign(document.createElement('a'), { href: url, download: filename }).click();
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}

export const socketUrl = (path: string) =>
  `${location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss' : 'ws'}://${location.host}/api/v1${path}`;
```

**`apps/web/src/main.tsx`** — the guard checks the token at render time, so it sees a login that happened after the page loaded.

```tsx
import { StrictMode, type ReactNode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Navigate } from 'react-router';
import './index.css';
import { getToken } from './api';
import Login from './pages/Login';
import Ingest from './pages/Ingest';
import Confirm from './pages/Confirm';
import Workspace from './pages/Workspace';
import Gallery from './pages/Gallery';

function Guard({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return getToken() ? children : <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
}

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: '/login', element: <Login /> },
  { path: '/', element: <Guard><Ingest /></Guard> },
  { path: '/sources/:id', element: <Guard><Confirm /></Guard> },
  { path: '/batches/:id', element: <Guard><Workspace /></Guard> },
  { path: '/gallery', element: <Gallery /> },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode><RouterProvider router={router} /></StrictMode>,
);
```

This replaces the scaffold's placeholder `main.tsx`. Delete `src/App.tsx` and `src/App.test.tsx` in the same commit.

**`apps/web/src/pages/Login.tsx`**

```tsx
import { useState, type FormEvent } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';
import { api, setToken } from '../api';

export default function Login() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  async function submit(e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const f = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
    try {
      const r = await api<{ token: string }>('/auth/login', {
        method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ name: f.get('name'), password: f.get('password') }) });
      setToken(r.token);
      navigate('/');
    } catch (err) { setError((err as Error).message); }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={submit} className="mx-auto mt-24 max-w-sm space-y-4 rounded-lg border p-6">
      <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Sign in</h1>
      <input name="name" placeholder="operator" className="w-full rounded border px-3 py-2" />
      <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="Password" className="w-full rounded border px-3 py-2" />
      {error && <p className="text-sm text-red-700">{error}</p>}
      <button className="w-full rounded bg-slate-900 py-2 text-white">Sign in</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

`StrictMode` runs every effect twice in development. That is intended: it proves the socket hook in Step 5 cleans up after itself. If you see two connections per batch in DevTools during development, that is StrictMode, not a bug.

## Step 4 — Ingest, confirm and configure

Two screens take the operator from raw text to a running batch. Ingestion waits for fact extraction, which can take 5 to 40 seconds, so the button must say what is happening rather than just spin.

**`apps/web/src/pages/Ingest.tsx`**

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';
import type { Classification, SourceRecord } from '@ps154/shared';
import { api } from '../api';

const TIERS: { value: Classification; label: string; consequence: string }[] = [
  { value: 'public', label: 'Public',
    consequence: 'Sent to the cloud model. Best quality and speed. For material cleared for release.' },
  { value: 'internal', label: 'Internal',
    consequence: 'Sent to the cloud model with IP addresses, domains, emails and named terms masked first, then restored.' },
  { value: 'restricted', label: 'Restricted',
    consequence: 'Processed entirely on this machine. Never sent to an external provider.' },
];

export default function Ingest() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [file, setFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
  const [tier, setTier] = useState<Classification>('internal');
  const [busy, setBusy] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  async function submit() {
    setBusy(true); setError('');
    try {
      let body: BodyInit;
      if (file) {
        const form = new FormData();
        form.append('classification', tier);
        form.append('file', file);
        body = form;
      } else {

**`apps/web/src/components/ConfigPanel.tsx`** — builds exactly the request body in SRS §10.2. An override that says *same as global* is dropped, so `effective_config` only records real overrides.

**`apps/web/src/pages/Confirm.tsx`**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router';
import type { BatchCreated, SourceRecord } from '@ps154/shared';
import { api } from '../api';
import { FactsPanel } from '../components/FactsPanel';
import { ConfigPanel, type FormatOption } from '../components/ConfigPanel';
import { SourcePane } from '../components/SourcePane';

// Until B serves GET /formats from D's registry, this list stands in for it.
const FALLBACK: FormatOption[] = [
  { id: 'advisory', label: 'Security advisory' },
  { id: 'executive_summary', label: 'Executive summary' },
  { id: 'linkedin_post', label: 'LinkedIn post' },
];

export default function Confirm() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [source, setSource] = useState<SourceRecord | null>(null);
  const [formats, setFormats] = useState<FormatOption[]>(FALLBACK);
  const [busy, setBusy] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    api<SourceRecord>(`/sources/${id}`).then(setSource);
    api<FormatOption[]>('/formats').then(setFormats).catch(() => {});
  }, [id]);
  if (!source) return <p className="p-8">Loading source…</p>;

  async function generate(body: object) {
    setBusy(true);
    const batch = await api<BatchCreated>('/jobs/batch', {
      method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ source_id: source!.id, ...body }) });

```

`SourcePane` is built in Step 7; until then, render `source.raw_content` inside a `<pre>`.

## Step 5 — The workspace: state and the live stream

**One status per card, never one for the page** (SRS §11.1). Cards live in a record keyed by `task_id`. A frame patches exactly one card and leaves the others untouched, so the slowest format never holds the page hostage and a failed one never blanks it.

```text
GET /jobs/{id}  --> fromSnapshot --> view.cards { t1, t2, t3 }   + stream_last_id
                                          ^
WebSocket frame --> reducer(view, frame) -+  patches ONE card by task_id
(reconnects with since = last seq seen, so nothing is lost or applied twice)
```

**`apps/web/src/batch/state.ts`**

```ts
import type { Artifact, BatchSnapshot, Config, Frame } from '@ps154/shared';

export type Card = {
  task_id: string;
  format_id: string;
  status: Artifact['status'];
  effective_config: Config;
  detail?: string;
  started_at?: number;
  artifact?: Artifact;
  error?: { code: string; message: string; retryable: boolean };
};
export type BatchView = {
  batch_id: string; overall: string; last_seq: string;
  global_config: Config; cards: Record<string, Card>;
};

export function fromSnapshot(s: BatchSnapshot): BatchView {
  const cards: Record<string, Card> = {};
  for (const a of s.artifacts) {
    cards[a.task_id] = {
      task_id: a.task_id, format_id: a.format_id, status: a.status, effective_config: a.effective_config,
      artifact: a.status === 'ready' ? a : undefined,
      error: a.status === 'error'
        ? { code: 'FAILED', message: a.error_log ?? 'Generation failed', retryable: true } : undefined,
    };
  }
  return { batch_id: s.batch_id, overall: s.overall_status, last_seq: s.stream_last_id,
           global_config: s.global_config, cards };
}

export type Action =
  | { type: 'frame'; frame: Frame }
  | { type: 'regenerating'; task_id: string };

export function reducer(state: BatchView, action: Action): BatchView {
  if (action.type === 'regenerating') {
    return { ...patch(state, action.task_id,
      { status: 'waiting', artifact: undefined, error: undefined, detail: undefined }), overall: 'running' };
  }
  const f = action.frame;
  const s = { ...state, last_seq: f.seq };
  switch (f.event) {
    case 'task.progress':
      return patch(s, f.task_id, {
        status: f.status, detail: f.detail,
        started_at: f.status === 'running' ? Date.now() : state.cards[f.task_id]?.started_at });
    case 'task.completed':
      return patch(s, f.task_id, { status: 'ready', artifact: f.artifact, error: undefined, detail: undefined });
    case 'task.failed':
      return patch(s, f.task_id, { status: 'error',
        error: { code: f.error_code, message: f.message, retryable: f.retryable } });
    case 'batch.completed':
      return { ...s, overall: f.overall_status };
  }
}

function patch(s: BatchView, id: string, p: Partial<Card>): BatchView {
  const prev = s.cards[id];
  if (!prev) return s; // a frame for a task this page does not know: ignore it
  return { ...s, cards: { ...s.cards, [id]: { ...prev, ...p } } };
}
```

**`apps/web/src/batch/useBatchStream.ts`** — AC-13 lives here.

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import type { Frame } from '@ps154/shared';
import { getToken, socketUrl } from '../api';

/** Streams frames after `since`; after a drop, reconnects from the last frame seen. */
export function useBatchStream(batchId: string, since: string, onFrame: (f: Frame) => void) {
  const handler = useRef(onFrame);
  handler.current = onFrame;

  useEffect(() => {
    let last = since;
    let ws: WebSocket | null = null;
    let stopped = false;
    let retry = 0;
    let timer: number | undefined;

    const connect = () => {
      ws = new WebSocket(socketUrl(
        `/jobs/${batchId}/stream?since=${encodeURIComponent(last)}&token=${getToken()}`));
      ws.onopen = () => { retry = 0; };
      ws.onmessage = (e) => {
        const frame = JSON.parse(e.data) as Frame;
        last = frame.seq;
        handler.current(frame);
      };
      ws.onclose = () => {
        if (!stopped) timer = window.setTimeout(connect, Math.min(500 * 2 ** retry++, 8000));
      };
    };
    connect();
    return () => { stopped = true; window.clearTimeout(timer); ws?.close(); };
  }, [batchId, since]);
}
```

**`apps/web/src/selection.tsx`** — which claim is selected, shared by every card and the source pane.

```tsx
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

  async function regenerate(task_id: string) {
    dispatch({ type: 'regenerating', task_id });

}
```

**Saturday's gate test.** Paste the demo source and generate three formats against B's stub engine. Three cards appear instantly as *waiting*, then move through *running* and *validating* to *ready* one at a time. The page never shows a single global spinner.

## Step 6 — Cards

A card has six states, and each must look different: a queued card that looks like a running one makes the page seem frozen (SRS §11.3). Every card sits inside its own error boundary, so one malformed artefact can never take its siblings down with it.

| Status | The card shows |
| --- | --- |
| `waiting` | *Queued — starts when one of three slots frees* |
| `running` | *Writing* and an elapsed timer |
| `validating` | *Checking facts* and the timer |
| `revising` | *Repairing* plus the detail, for example *1 finding* |
| `ready` | The content, the verification badge, provider badge, actions |
| `error` | The message and a Retry button |

**`apps/web/src/components/CardBoundary.tsx`**

```tsx
import { Component, type ReactNode } from 'react';

export class CardBoundary extends Component<{ label: string; children: ReactNode }, { error: Error | null }> {

      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**`apps/web/src/components/VerificationBadge.tsx`** — the visible half of D's verifier, and the AC-16 moment.

```tsx

```

**`apps/web/src/renderers/index.tsx`** — three designed views for Phase 1, and one generic walker so any new format renders with no new code (AC-12).

          <CardView card={c} globalConfig={a.effective_config} onRegenerate={() => {}} />
        </CardBoundary>
      ))}
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Step 7 — The provenance split view

This is the most important interaction in the product (SRS §5.5, AC-2). Selecting any sentence in any card highlights the passage it came from in the source pane, scrolls to it, and shows the page for PDFs. It turns *an AI wrote this* into *here is where every sentence came from*. Build it before any polish.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant O as Operator
  participant C as ClaimSpan
  participant S as Selection context
  participant P as SourcePane
  O->>C: clicks "37 organisations recorded..."
  C->>S: select(claim)
  S-->>P: active refs = span_6
  P->>P: highlight span_6, add page chip
  P->>P: scroll span_6 into view
  O->>C: clicks it again
  C->>S: select(null), highlight clears
```

**How each claim looks.** The operator must be able to see, without clicking, which sentences the source supports and which the model reasoned its way to (SRS §11.4).

| Claim | Looks like | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fact`, grounded | Plain; underline on hover | Normal reading, but clickable |
| `inference`, grounded | Dotted blue underline and an *inferred* tag | Reasoning, not reading — visible at a glance |
| Not grounded | Wavy amber underline and an *unverified* tag | Where a reviewer's attention should go first |
| `framing` | Plain text, not clickable | It asserts nothing |
| Selected | Yellow highlight with a ring | The same yellow as its source passage, so the link reads by colour |

**`apps/web/src/components/ClaimSpan.tsx`**

```tsx
import type { Claim } from '@ps154/shared';
import { useSelection } from '../selection';

export function ClaimSpan({ claim }: { claim: Claim }) {
  const { active, select } = useSelection();
  if (claim.status === 'framing') return <span>{claim.text} </span>;
  // Compare by object, not id: every card numbers its claims from c1.
  const isActive = active === claim;
  const style = !claim.grounded
    ? 'bg-amber-50 underline decoration-amber-500 decoration-wavy'
    : claim.status === 'inference'
      ? 'underline decoration-sky-500 decoration-dotted underline-offset-4'
      : 'hover:bg-sky-50 hover:underline';
  const toggle = () => select(isActive ? null : claim);
  return (
    <>
      <span role="button" tabIndex={0} onClick={toggle} onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && toggle()}
        className={`cursor-pointer rounded-sm transition-colors ${style} ${isActive ? 'bg-yellow-200 ring-2 ring-yellow-400' : ''}`}>
        {claim.text}
        {claim.grounded && claim.status === 'inference' &&
          <sup className="ml-1 text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase text-sky-700">inferred</sup>}
        {!claim.grounded &&
          <sup className="ml-1 text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase text-amber-700">unverified</sup>}
      </span>{' '}
    </>
  );
}
```

**`apps/web/src/components/SourcePane.tsx`** — rebuilds the original text from its spans, so the gaps between sentences keep their line breaks.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useRef, type ReactNode } from 'react';
import type { Span } from '@ps154/shared';

export function SourcePane({ raw, spans, active }: { raw: string; spans: Span[]; active: Set<string> }) {
  const nodes = useRef(new Map<string, HTMLElement>());

  useEffect(() => {
    const first = spans.find((s) => active.has(s.span_id));
    if (first) nodes.current.get(first.span_id)?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
  }, [active, spans]);

  const parts: ReactNode[] = [];
  let cursor = 0;
  for (const s of spans) {
    if (s.start_offset > cursor) parts.push(raw.slice(cursor, s.start_offset));
    const on = active.has(s.span_id);
    parts.push(
      <span key={s.span_id} ref={(el) => { if (el) nodes.current.set(s.span_id, el); }}
        className={`transition-colors ${on ? 'rounded bg-yellow-200 ring-2 ring-yellow-400' : ''}`}>
        {raw.slice(s.start_offset, s.end_offset)}
        {on && s.page !== undefined &&
          <sup className="ml-1 rounded bg-slate-800 px-1 text-[10px] text-white">p.{s.page}</sup>}
      </span>,
    );
    cursor = s.end_offset;
  }
  parts.push(raw.slice(cursor));
  return <div className="whitespace-pre-wrap text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-slate-800">{parts}</div>;
}
```

**Add to the source section of `Workspace.tsx`**, above `SourcePane` — an unverified claim has no passage to light up, and silence would look broken.

```tsx
{active && active.source_refs.length === 0 && (
  <p className="mb-3 rounded bg-amber-50 p-2 text-sm text-amber-900">
    This sentence cites no passage in the source. It is marked unverified.
  </p>
)}
```

**Sunday's gate test (AC-2).** Generate the three formats from the demo source. Click a sentence in the LinkedIn post whose source sits low in the document: the pane must scroll and highlight the right sentence. Click an *inferred* claim; then the unverified one from the mock. Rehearse on a claim far down the page — on stage, the visible scroll is what sells it.

## Step 8 — Demo polish and the screenshots

The deck is judged partly on these screenshots, so treat them as a deliverable with a deadline: Sunday evening, to A.

**Projector mode.** A judge reads the screen from across a room (NFR-14). Tailwind sizes in `rem`, so one root font size scales the whole interface.

Add to `src/index.css`, under the import:

```css
html.projector { font-size: 19px; }
html.projector body { color: #0f172a; }
```

Add to `src/main.tsx`:

```ts
// Alt+P toggles projector mode.
window.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.altKey && e.key.toLowerCase() === 'p') document.documentElement.classList.toggle('projector');
});
```

**Before any screenshot or recording:** projector mode on, browser zoom 110–125%, bookmarks bar hidden, no personal tabs, 1920×1080, PNG.

**The six screenshots A needs.**

| # | Screen and state | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ingest with **Restricted** selected, its consequence sentence readable | Sovereignty is a choice with a stated effect |
| 2 | Confirm: the extracted-facts panel beside the source | The system understood before it wrote |
| 3 | Workspace mid-run: one card ready, one revising, one running | Independent, live cards |
| 4 | A LinkedIn sentence selected, its passage highlighted in the source | Every sentence is traceable. **The key image of the deck** |
| 5 | The verification badge expanded: *Repaired — 42 does not appear in the cited source* | The system catches its own errors. Caption it *fault injected for demonstration* |
| 6 | A restricted run's card showing *processed on this machine*, beside B's network-monitor screenshot | Restricted content never left the laptop |

**Review, if Monday allows — otherwise Phase 2.** Put the actions in the card footer rather than building a separate page. Operators see *Submit for review* on a draft; reviewers see *Approve* and *Reject with comment* on a submitted card. After a successful call, update that card's `review_state` locally, because review changes do not travel on the stream. Use `getUser().role` only to decide which buttons to show; the server enforces the real check.

## Step 9 — Test as you build

Before every pull request, run `npm run check`: typecheck, every test, and the production build — exactly what CI repeats on Linux. Component tests run in jsdom, a simulated browser, so they need neither B's API nor a real browser, and they take seconds.

| Layer | Command, from the repo root | Needs running | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Component and state tests | `npm run test:watch -w @ps154/web` while coding | Nothing | On save |
| Typecheck, tests, build | `npm run check` | Nothing | Before every PR |
| Gallery | `http://localhost:5173/gallery` | `npm run dev:web` | After any card change: every state still renders |
| Live acceptance | AC-2, AC-9, AC-13, AC-16 by hand, as in each step's gate test | B's API and worker; D's engine for AC-16 | At each day's gate |

**How to write them.** A test file sits beside the file it tests. Find elements the way a user would — by role, label or visible text — not by class names, except where the class *is* the behaviour, as with the provenance highlight. `userEvent` clicks and types like a person; `vi.fn()` stands in for callbacks such as `onGenerate`.

Add each file in the same PR as the code it tests.

| File | Add with | Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/components/ConfigPanel.test.tsx` | Step 4 | An override is sent for one format only; *same as global* drops it; Generate is disabled at zero (AC-11, FR-13) |
| `src/batch/state.test.ts` | Step 5 | A frame patches one card; a failure leaves siblings intact and reads `partial`; snapshots rebuild cards (AC-9) |
| `src/batch/useBatchStream.test.ts` | Step 5 | After a drop the socket reconnects from the last `seq`; unmounting never reconnects (AC-13) |
| `src/components/Card.test.tsx` | Step 6 | Queued and running look different; Retry works; override badge; one crashing card spares the rest; `1 fix` expands (AC-9, AC-11, AC-16) |
| `src/components/ClaimSpan.test.tsx` | Step 7 | Clicking a claim highlights its passage and page, and a second click clears it; claim tags; two cards reusing an id (AC-2) |

**When a test fails.** Vitest prints the expected and received values side by side. Put `screen.debug()` above the failing line to print the DOM as the test sees it. Run one file with `npm run test -w @ps154/web -- src/components/Card.test.tsx`. Turborepo prints `FULL TURBO` when nothing changed since the last green run; `npx turbo run test --force` reruns everything.

**What no unit test replaces.** Before each gate, run the real thing: the AC-2 click on a claim far down the demo source (Step 7), a failing card beside two ready ones (B's Step 6 shows how to make the stub fail), the DevTools *Offline* drop for AC-13 (Step 5), and the `1 fix` badge with D's `DEMO_PERTURB=1`. Tests prove the logic; the rehearsal proves the demo.

## Step 10 — Open a pull request

Nobody pushes to `main`. Every change reaches it through a pull request that CI has checked and one teammate has approved.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C1["git switch -c web/provenance"] --> C2[Build + tests]
  C2 --> C3["npm run check<br/>+ screenshot"]
  C3 --> C4[git push]
  C4 --> C5[Open PR]
  C5 --> C6{"CI green<br/>+ 1 approval"}
  C6 -->|changes asked| C2
  C6 -->|yes| C7[Squash and merge]
  C7 --> C8["git switch main<br/>git pull"]
```

**1. Start from the latest `main`, on a new branch.** Name it `web/` plus the piece: `web/login`, `web/workspace-stream`, `web/cards`, `web/provenance`.

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c web/provenance
```

**2. Commit as you go.** Small commits whose messages say what changed: `web: highlight the cited passage when a claim is selected (AC-2)`. Stage `apps/web` by name, never everything, so nothing from another folder or a stray file slips in:

```bash
git status
git add apps/web
git commit -m "web: highlight the cited passage when a claim is selected (AC-2)"
```

**3. Check, then push.**

```bash
npm run check                          # must be green: CI runs exactly this
git push -u origin web/provenance      # later pushes: plain git push
```

**4. Open the pull request.** Open [the repository](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154): a *Compare & pull request* banner appears for a freshly pushed branch. If it has gone, use [New pull request](https://github.com/MdFareedKhan01/sih_ps154/compare) and pick your branch. Base `main`, compare your branch. Fill in the template: the guide step and AC, what you clicked to check it, and **a screenshot or short GIF of every screen you changed** — `Win + Shift + S`, then paste straight into the description; ScreenToGif for a clip. These double as A's deck material. With the GitHub CLI installed, `gh pr create --fill --base main` opens it from the terminal.

| Your change | Ask for review from |
| --- | --- |
| A screen calls a new endpoint, or reads a response differently | B |
| Claims, the verification badge or provider badges render differently | D |
| Anything else in `apps/web` | B or D, whoever is free first |
| You need a new field in `packages/shared` | Do not edit it yourself: ask B or D in the team chat, and they open that PR |

Commit a mock only if it comes from the synthetic demo source — never from real data.

**5. Review and merge.** A red cross from CI means `npm run check` fails on Linux: click *Details*, fix it, push again, and the PR updates itself. Once CI is green and a teammate has approved, press **Squash and merge**, then **Delete branch**. Then, locally:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
npm install        # only when the pull changed package-lock.json
```

**Keeping a long branch current.** If `main` moved while you worked, merge it into your branch rather than rebasing, so nothing needs a force-push:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main      # fix any conflicts, then:
npm run check
git push
```

**Reviewing B's API pull requests.** You are the API's first real client. Check the branch out (`git fetch origin`, `git switch <their-branch>`, `npm install`), start the API, worker and web, and click through the screens the change touches. Approve with what you checked, or request changes naming the exact response that broke a screen.

## Phase 2 and troubleshooting

### Phase 2 — after the submission

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Review queue page | Needs a list endpoint from B, such as `GET /tasks?review_state=submitted` |
| X thread and video renderers | The thread as numbered tweets with a 280-character meter; the video as a horizontal timeline of scene cards, with a play button that reads narration through the browser's `SpeechSynthesis` |
| Hindi | Load a Devanagari font such as Noto Sans Devanagari, and check card layouts with longer lines |
| Admin audit view | The latest rows, plus a *Verify chain* button calling `GET /audit/verify` — the AC-14 moment on screen |
| Presentation stretch format | A slide-by-slide preview; the `.pptx` comes from B's exporter |
| Accessibility pass | Focus rings, keyboard selection of claims, colour contrast checked in projector mode |

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Failed to resolve import "@ps154/shared"` | The package is not linked | Run `npm install` from the repo root; check both package names |
| Tailwind classes do nothing | The CSS import or the Vite plugin is missing | Recheck Step 0 |
| The socket closes immediately | Proxy without `ws: true`, or no token in the URL | Check `vite.config.ts`; inspect the socket URL in DevTools → Network → WS |
| Cards never leave *waiting* | B's worker is not running | `npm run dev:worker` in its own terminal |
| Clicking a claim highlights nothing | Its span ids do not exist in this source | The Friday mock ids are illustrative: switch to a real snapshot |
| Selecting one claim highlights claims in every card | Claims compared by `id` | Compare by object, as in Step 7 |
| A TypeScript error on the JSON import in `Gallery.tsx` | JSON modules are not enabled | The scaffold sets `"resolveJsonModule": true` in `tsconfig.app.json`; check nobody removed it |
| `scrollIntoView is not a function` in a test | The test setup did not load | `setupFiles` in `vite.config.ts` must point at `./src/test/setup.ts` |
| `toBeInTheDocument is not a function` | The jest-dom matchers did not load | `src/test/setup.ts` must import `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` |
| A test passes alone but fails beside others | Fake timers or a stubbed global left behind | Undo them in `afterEach`, as `useBatchStream.test.ts` does |
| Tests pass locally, CI fails at `build` | `tsc -b` also type-checks test files | Run `npm run check` locally and fix the error it prints |
| `Failed to resolve import "@ps154/shared/..."` after a pull | A teammate added a dependency | `npm install` at the repo root |
| Two sockets per batch in development | React `StrictMode` runs effects twice | Expected in development; production opens one |
| A 401 bounces you to login mid-demo | The 12-hour token expired | Log in again just before presenting |
